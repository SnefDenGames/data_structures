### Explanation:
The [`Dictionary`](https://docs.rs/data_structures_SD/0.1.0/data_structures_SD/lists/dictionary/struct.Dictionary.html) is a data structur, that is containing key-data pairs. That means, that you need the key of the pair to get the data. Like you look in a dictonary for the translation of bottle (key) in german. In this example the return value (data) would be the word Flasche.
